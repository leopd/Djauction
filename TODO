Must...


Important...
Receipt has BNCO logo on it.
One button that saves and then prints.
    "How do you expose a django admin 'action' on the change form page.
    In particular, I'd love a button which saves the current object and
    then performs an action."
    idea... override something in modeladmin



Nice...
Whole line is hyperlinked in person table.
